plt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar = True, cmap = 'cool')
plt.title('Visualizing missing values')
plt.show()


# ## Observation
# 
# --Missing Values Summary: The summary shows that some columns have missing values (NaN or null values), while others have no missing values.
# 
# Columns with Missing Values: There are several columns with missing values, most notably "City" and "Select Investors." These columns have 16 and 1 missing values, respectively.
# 
# --Impact on Analysis: The presence of missing values can impact your data analysis. For example, if you plan to use the "City" column for geographical analysis, you may need to address the missing values to ensure your analysis is comprehensive.
# 
# --Data Cleaning: To address missing values, you can consider techniques such as imputation, where you fill in missing values with appropriate data (e.g., filling missing cities based on the country or using mode imputation for "Select Investors").
# 
# --Data Quality: It's essential to assess whether the missing data affects the quality and reliability of your analysis. Depending on your objectives, you may need to decide how to handle missing values, whether through imputation or excluding rows with missing data.
# 
# --Data Preprocessing: This step is a critical part of data preprocessing before performing any analysis or visualization. Addressing missing values ensures that your analysis is based on complete and accurate data.
# 
# Consider Data Sources: If the missing data in "City" is related to the source of your dataset, you might want to verify whether the original data source contains this information or if there are alternative sources to supplement the missing data.
# 
# --Documentation: Document the steps you take to handle missing values. Transparency in data preprocessing is essential for reproducibility and sharing your findings with others.
# 
# In summary, the presence of missing values is a common data issue, and addressing them is crucial for accurate and reliable data analysis. Depending on your specific analysis objectives, you may choose to impute missing data or take other appropriate actions to ensure the quality of your dataset.

## Data Cleaning
# Renaming columns
df.rename(columns={'Date Joined': 'Date', 'Valuation ': 'Valuation (B$)', 'Select Investors': 'Investors'}, inplace=True)

# Convert 'Investors' column to a string
df['Investors'] = df['Investors'].astype(str)
df


# In[6]:


# Remove '$' from 'Valuation' column and convert it to numeric
df['Valuation'] = df['Valuation'].str.replace('$', '')
df['Valuation'] = df['Valuation'].str.replace('B', '')
df['Valuation'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Valuation'])
df


# In[7]:


# Remove '$' from 'Valuation' column and convert it to numeric
df['Funding'] = df['Funding'].str.replace('$', '')
df['Funding'] = df['Funding'].str.replace('B', '')
df['Funding'] = df['Funding'].str.replace('M', '')
df['Funding'] = df['Funding'].str.replace('Unknown', '')
df['Funding'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Funding'])
df


# In[8]:


# Calculate ROI and add it as a new column
df['ROI'] = df['Valuation'] - df['Funding']
df


# In[9]:


# check for negative values in quantity
df[df['ROI'] < 0]


# In[10]:


# Optionally, you can sort the DataFrame by 'ROI' in ascending order
df = df.sort_values(by='ROI', ascending=False).head()
df


# ## Data cleaning is important for getting a good result.
# In the first segment, I renamed a few column names.
# Like, Data Joined to Date, Select Investors to Investors and aslo create a new column called Return upon Investment (ROI).
#  
# These data should be numeric. So, using pandas we assign the data type to numeric.
# Now in the valuation column, We know that all the values are in Billion Dollars. 
# Thatâ€™s why we removed the ($B) from the column. And make sure that the data type should be numeric.

# 
# -Observations from the map chart:
# 
# -Geographical Distribution: The map provides a geographical perspective on where the top-funded companies or investments are located. It allows us to visually compare funding levels across different countries.
# 
# -Top Funding Countries: The countries with the darkest shades on the map are the top 20 countries with the highest funding amounts. These countries have attracted significant investments.
# 
# -Hover Information: Hovering over a country on the map reveals additional details, including the country's name and the specific funding amount. This interactive feature enables users to explore the data further.
# 
# -Color Scale: The choice of the Plasma color scale helps differentiate funding levels effectively. Darker colors represent higher funding, while lighter colors represent lower funding.
# 
# -Geographical Patterns: The map may reveal geographical patterns in funding, such as regions or clusters where investment activity is particularly concentrated.
# 
# Overall, the map chart offers a clear visual representation of funding distribution across countries and helps identify the top funding destinations in the dataset.

# ### RECOMMENDATION

# *After performing a basic exploratory data analysis of the Unicorn Companies dataset, here are four data-driven overall recommendations to help Unicorn Companies in creating good business models, making investment decisions that focus on companies with high growth potential, diversifying their investment portfolio, and prioritizing companies with experienced leadership teams:
# 
# Identify High Growth Potential Sectors:
# 
# *Recommendation: Analyze industry sectors and identify those with a high growth potential based on historical funding trends and valuation growth.
# Rationale: By understanding which industry sectors have attracted the most funding and demonstrated substantial valuation growth, Unicorn Companies can focus their investments on sectors that are likely to continue flourishing. This approach can help maximize returns on investments.
# Diversify Investment Portfolio Across Regions:
# 
# *Recommendation: Diversify the investment portfolio across different regions or countries to reduce geographic concentration risk.
# Rationale: Geographical diversification can mitigate risks associated with economic, political, or regulatory changes in a particular region. By investing in companies from diverse regions, Unicorn Companies can spread their risk and access a broader range of growth opportunities.
# Prioritize Companies with Experienced Leadership Teams:
# 
# *Recommendation: Place a strong emphasis on companies with experienced and proven leadership teams when making investment decisions.
# Rationale: The quality of a company's leadership team plays a critical role in its success. Companies led by experienced founders and executives are more likely to navigate challenges effectively and execute growth strategies. Unicorn Companies should conduct due diligence on the leadership teams of potential investments.
# Monitor Early-Stage Startups for Growth Potential:
# 
# *Recommendation: Continuously monitor early-stage startups in the portfolio for signs of high growth potential, such as rapid user adoption, revenue growth, and market expansion.
# Rationale: Startups can experience exponential growth at various stages of their development. Unicorn Companies should stay vigilant and adapt their investment strategies to support and nurture companies that exhibit strong growth indicators. Regularly reassessing the portfolio ensures that they capitalize on emerging opportunities.
# These recommendations are data-driven and aim to help Unicorn Companies make informed decisions to create robust business models, maximize returns, and manage risk effectively. By focusing on sectors with growth potential, diversifying investments, prioritizing experienced leadership, and actively monitoring startups, Unicorn Companies can enhance their investment strategy and increase their chances of success in the dynamic world of startup investments.
