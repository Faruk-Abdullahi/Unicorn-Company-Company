# Unicorn-Company-Company
Quantum Analytics for Python

Unicorn is a multibillion naira company having thousands of susbcribers around the world. i have been able to perform a basic exploratory data analysis of the features of the Unicorn Companies dataset and come up with some data driven insights to help Unicorn Companies in creating good business models and making decisions that will focus on companies with high growth and expansion. 

One of the challenges ecounter during the analysis was at data cleaning state as it is known as a fundamental process for better data analysis. I had to convert the Valuation Colunm and the Funding Column to float which i found very difficult because of the string element present in the column making data manipulation very hard and difficult.

Another things was also finding out how to deal with the negative values in the ROI and to why some companies got negative ROI. 
 However, all the same i was able to take up these reasearch work and came up with some meaniful insights despite the chanllenges.

Thank you.
